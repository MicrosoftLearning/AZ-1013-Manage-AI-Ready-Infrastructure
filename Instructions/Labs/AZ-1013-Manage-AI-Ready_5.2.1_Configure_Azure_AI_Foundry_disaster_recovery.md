# AI Ready Manage hands-on exercise: Configure Azure AI Foundry hub disaster recovery

## Background information
Azure AI Foundry offers a unified platform for managing AI development and deployment lifecycles, integrating capabilities for data preparation, experimentation, model training, and deployment. While Microsoft provides high availability for Azure services, unplanned regional outages can still occur, making it essential for organizations to plan and implement a disaster recovery (DR) strategy. Azure AI Foundry itself doesn't provide built-in automatic failover, so resilience should be achieved through a customer-managed approach that replicates critical components and configurations across multiple regions. Microsoft documentation illustrates such approach for hub-based deployments.

A sound recovery strategy for Azure AI Foundry hubs depends on several associated Azure services. The Azure AI Foundry infrastructure is managed by Microsoft, but many supporting services (such as Azure Storage, Azure Key Vault, Azure Container Registry, and Application Insights) are customer-managed and must be configured for disaster recovery. For example, Azure Key Vault provides built-in regional redundancy in most regions, while Azure Container Registry Premium supports geo-replication, allowing registry content to be synchronized across paired regions. Other services, such as Storage and Application Insights, require manual configuration and coordination between regions to ensure data consistency and recovery readiness. In particular, Azure Storage accounts used by Azure AI Foundry do not support geo-replication, requiring separate regional instances and custom synchronization of their content to maintain availability during failover.

A multi-region deployment is the foundation of a robust DR plan. It involves creating duplicate AI Foundry hubs and associated resources in two paired Azure regionsâ€”one serving as the primary and the other as the secondary (failover) environment. During a regional outage, workloads can be redirected to the secondary region with minimal downtime. Proper planning ensures that compute capacity, credentials, model artifacts, and registry data remain available and synchronized between regions, maximizing the ability to resume operations quickly and maintain continuity of AI-driven services.

## Scenario
Your company plans to build a centralized AI platform on Azure AI Foundry to support enterprise-scale model development, experimentation, and deployment. To safeguard against potential regional service interruptions and ensure business continuity, your company will implement a disaster recovery configuration for its Azure AI Foundry hub. The solution will include deploying a primary hub and a secondary hub in paired Azure regions, ensuring that critical resources, including the Key Vault and Container Registry, are available and synchronized across both locations. The Azure Container Registry will be configured with geo-replication, while the Key Vault will leverage its built-in regional redundancy features to maintain availability of its artifacts. Replication of Storage accounts will be implemented later through a custom, automated process to ensure consistent data availability across regions.

## Prerequisites
- **Azure subscription**: If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.
- **Permissions**: To create Azure AI Services resources, you should have the Owner role assigned at the Azure subscription.
- **Familiarity with Azure AI Foundry resource types**: To learn more, refer to [Choose an Azure resource type for AI foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/concepts/resource-types).

20 minutes

### Task 1: Create a disaster recovery-capable Azure Key Vault instance

1. Start a web browser, navigate to the Azure portal at [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com) and sign in by providing the credentials of a user account which has the Owner role assigned at the Azure subscription level.
1. In the Azure portal, use the **Search** text box at the top of the page to search for **Key vaults** and, in the list of results, select **Key vaults**.
1. On the **Key vaults** page, select **+ Create**.
1. On the **Basics** tab of the **Create a key vault** page, specify the following settings (leave others with their default values) and select **Next**:

   |Setting|Value|

   |Region|The name of the Azure region in which you intend to provision the primary instance of Azure AI Foundry hub|
   |Pricing tier|**Standard**|

   **Note**: Choose any Azure region that supports deployments of Azure AI Foundry hubs and which has a corresponding paired region. For the list of regions in this category, refer to [Azure region pairs and nonpaired regions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/reliability/regions-paired).
