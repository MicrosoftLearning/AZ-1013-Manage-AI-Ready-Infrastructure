# AI Ready Manage hands-on exercise: Create an Azure AI Foundry resource and project level storage connection

## Background information
Azure AI Foundry provides a unified environment for building, managing, and deploying AI workloads. In this model, deployments can be hub-based or resource-based. A hub acts as a higher-level construct that organizes and manages multiple Azure AI Foundry resources, typically used in enterprise-scale setups that require multi-region management or shared governance across environments. A resource-based setup focuses on managing projects within a single Azure AI Foundry resource, where governance, networking, and identity settings are shared among those projects.

In a resource-based deployment, each project operates as a child resource of the Azure AI Foundry resource, inheriting its security and governance settings while enabling collaboration within a shared environment. Projects can also define their own managed identities and connections, allowing precise access control to external Azure services. By default, all projects under the same resource share core configurations such as networking, deployment settings, and integrated tools, but they can also establish project-specific connections for resources that need to remain private to an individual project.

Connections in Azure AI Foundry define secure integrations between a Foundry resource or a specific project and external Azure services, such as Azure Storage, Azure AI Search, or Key Vault. A resource-level connection created on the Foundry resource is shared with its projects, while a project-level connection is scoped to a single project to preserve data and operational isolation when required. Authentication and authorization vary depending on the target service and connection type. When using Microsoft Entra ID for Azure services, access can be granted via methods such as user identities, managed identities, or service principals, with permissions enforced through Azure role-based access control (RBAC), eliminating the need for stored keys or credentials.

## Scenario
Your company plans to establish a secure and scalable development environment using Azure AI Foundry projects to manage AI workloads such as dataset preparation, model experimentation, and fine-tuning. As part of this initiative, the company will create an Azure AI Foundry resource that hosts multiple resource-based projects, each representing a distinct team or workload domain. This structure enables different teams to work independently on separate AI solutions while maintaining shared access to common services, infrastructure, and governance policies.

To enable access to Azure Storage, the company will configure two types of connections across these projects: a shared, resource-level connection to a storage account used for storing common artifacts, and project-level connections to separate storage accounts dedicated to each projectâ€™s private datasets and outputs. Both connection types will rely on Microsoft Entra ID authentication, ensuring secure, keyless access through system-assigned managed identities for automated operations and user-based credentials for interactive development in notebooks or playgrounds. This configuration will balance collaboration and isolation, supporting efficient and compliant AI development across the organization.
